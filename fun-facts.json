  "I debugged a carbureted 383 stroker engine before finishing my coffee — then spent two hours convincing TypeScript that a string was, in fact, a string.",
  "I got tired of third-party MDTs breaking scenes, so I accidentally started building my own CAD platform. This is how most of my projects begin.",
  "I made my first Discord bot out of spite toward MEE6 — now I maintain a framework that does ten times more and somehow still finds new ways to break.",
  "I tried to avoid panel fees and vendor lock-in. I am now the proud owner of a billing system, an admin panel, and several unresolved existential questions.",
  "I replaced a digital dash with analog gauges in an ’84 Corvette. It was still easier than designing a permissions system everyone agrees with.",
  "I build internal tools in silence and only mention them once they mostly work, which is why my collaborators say things like ‘Grey, stop making shit.’",
  "I once refactored a small helper function and emerged hours later with a new auth system, a migration plan, and absolutely no memory of how I got there.",
  "I trust systems I built at 3am more than third-party software with marketing pages and monthly fees."
