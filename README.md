## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend-focused developer with a passion for building secure, modular systems — especially for Discord bots, game hosting infrastructure, and developer tooling.  
With a strong interest in cybersecurity and automation, I love creating tools that not only work well, but scale cleanly. I’m currently pursuing a Computer Science degree while developing open-source projects under the ShadowDev ecosystem.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me working on cars, running custom RP servers, or designing dev workflows that save time and sanity.

I once debugged a carbureted 383 stroker engine before finishing my coffee — now I mostly debug TypeScript.
