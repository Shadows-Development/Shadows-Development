## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **backend-focused engineer and founder** with a strong emphasis on **security, reliability, and long-term maintainability**. I spend most of my time building internal platforms, developer tooling, and infrastructure that replaces third-party dependencies with systems we actually control.

I care less about flashy features and more about:
- clean architecture  
- strong permission models  
- auditability  
- and systems that scale without constant babysitting  

I’m currently pursuing a **Cybersecurity Engineering** degree while operating and developing multiple projects under Shadow Development LLC.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:
- working on cars  
- running RP infrastructure  
- or quietly removing vendor lock-in from places it shouldn’t exist

## 🏢 Shadow Development LLC

Shadow Development LLC is the umbrella for everything I build and operate — from public frameworks to private internal platforms.

The focus is simple:
- **own the stack**
- **control the data**
- **build once, scale responsibly**

Some projects are public.  
Some are internal.  
All are built with production use in mind.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧩 ShadowCore
**A modular TypeScript framework for building secure Discord bots and backend tooling.**

- Role guards, command/event architecture, CLI tooling
- Security-first defaults (Argon2, JWT, HMAC)
- Built for maintainability and extension, not copy-paste bots

---

### 📟 NyxCad *(Internal Platform · Pilot)*
**A next-generation CAD/MDT platform built as owned infrastructure.**

NyxCad is a **modular, security-first CAD/MDT system** designed for real production use — not as a marketplace script.

Key principles:
- full data ownership  
- Discord-backed permissions (no in-game OAuth pain)  
- collaborative reporting and modern scene workflows  
- tenant-aware, SaaS-ready architecture  

NyxCad is currently in **private development** and deployed as an **internal pilot system** within Shadow Development–operated environments.

It is intentionally **not public** at this stage.

---

### 🔐 ShadowVault *(In Progress)*
**Security-focused backend infrastructure and tooling.**

ShadowVault explores authentication, key management, and secure service design — with an emphasis on systems that can be safely deployed in real-world environments.

---

## 🎓 Education & Certifications

- 🎓 **Cybersecurity Engineeringe** — Iowa State University (Expected Graduation 2029)
- ✅ **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** (Coursera)

---

## 💡 Current Focus

- ShadowCore v2 architecture & tooling
- NyxCad CAD/MDT platform (pilot hardening)
- Internal infrastructure & automation
- Secure auth, permissions, and audit systems

---

## 📣 Open to Opportunities

I’m open to **backend engineering or cybersecurity internships** starting **Summer or Fall 2026**  
(remote or Des Moines, IA area).

I’m especially interested in roles involving:
- TypeScript / Node.js  
- backend systems  
- security tooling  
- internal platforms & infrastructure  

If you’re hiring — or know someone who is — feel free to reach out.

## 👾 Dev Logs from the Shadow Realm™

> A running archive of questionable decisions, cursed debugging sessions, and the occasional victory lap.

- 🧠 *TypeScript once told me a variable was possibly undefined — in the function that literally defined it.*
- 🕯 *Debugged a race condition by printing 13 logs and sacrificing a chicken. It worked. No further questions.*
- 🧱 *Started refactoring a helper function. Four hours later, I had a new auth system and three existential crises.*
- 🔄 *Accidentally wrote a recursive utility that crashed my terminal and taught me the value of `--max-old-space-size`.*
- 🐳 *Docker said “permission denied.” I gave it root. I gave it my soul. Still permission denied.*
- 🚪 *Wrote `exit(1)` just to feel something.*
- 🎭 *ShadowCore’s plugin system worked great until I accidentally registered the same command… six times. In production.*
- 🔐 *My JWT validator was so strict it denied itself. Very secure. No users allowed.*
- 🧩 *Tried “just one quick fix” in Prisma. Dropped half my relations and discovered a new religion.*
- 📡 *WebSocket reconnect logic was solid — until it reconnected 87 times per second. My logs became a strobe light.*
- 🚓 *My FiveM server booted perfectly. Nothing worked inside it, but the logs were clean and that’s what matters.*
- 🧯 *Installed a third-party Discord rate limiter to be safe. It rate-limited itself out of existence.*
- 🏁 *Launched a self-hosted Discord bot, integrated JWT auth, deployed via Docker, and it all worked on the first try. I checked three times — still worked. I fear I may have broken the laws of software.*
- 🛠 *Prisma stopped cooperating. Instead of debugging it, I wrote my own ORM. Because that’s apparently who I am now.*
- 🧟 *Accidentally wiped the entire ShadowORM repo. Spent an hour resurrecting blobs like a digital necromancer. Git has been appeased — for now.*

> _More logs will appear when something breaks in production._

I tried to avoid panel fees and vendor lock-in. I am now the proud owner of a billing system, an admin panel, and several unresolved existential questions.
