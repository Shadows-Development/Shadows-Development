## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend-focused developer with a passion for building secure, modular systems — especially for Discord bots, game hosting infrastructure, and developer tooling.  
With a strong interest in cybersecurity and automation, I love creating tools that not only work well, but scale cleanly. I’m currently pursuing a Computer Science degree while developing open-source projects under the ShadowDev ecosystem.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me working on cars, running custom RP servers, or designing dev workflows that save time and sanity.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧩 [ShadowCore](https://github.com/GreyDevOps/shadow-core)
> **A modular TypeScript framework for building secure, scalable Discord bots and backend tooling.**
> - CLI support, role guards, plugin-ready command/event structure
> - Security-first: Argon2, JWT, HMAC, and NestJS integration
> - Clean dev experience and extensible architecture
>
> ⚙️ **ShadowCore v2.0.0 is in active development.**  
> This update is expanding ShadowCore into a full-stack toolkit — supporting not only Discord bots, but also Express/NestJS APIs and CLI tooling.  
> While the **plugin system is delayed until v2.1.0**, v2.0.0 lays the groundwork with improved modularity, reusability, and security-by-default practices.  
> 📌 Follow progress on the [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/Shadows-Development/ShadowCore/tree/v2.0.0) branch and join the journey toward a truly universal TypeScript framework.

### 🔐 [ShadowVault](https://github.com/Shadows-Development/ShadowVault)
> **A security-first Express.js + TypeScript API boilerplate** designed for authentication, rate limiting, and modular structure.  
> Ideal for internal tools, dashboards, or microservices needing modern security best practices.

### 📟 [Project NyxCad](https://github.com/Shadows-Development/NyxCad) *(Private Preview)*  
> **A next-gen, cross-game CAD/MDT system** designed for FiveM, Roblox, and beyond — built under the ShadowDev ecosystem.  
> Modular. Secure. Developer-ready.

`Project NyxCad` is a universal dispatch and data platform for roleplay communities, built to scale from personal servers to full-blown hosted platforms. With support for multiple games through adapter modules and a plugin-ready API, it empowers communities to run efficient, modern RP systems without being locked into one ecosystem.

- 🧠 **Modular by design** – plugins, game adapters, and extensibility first  
- 🔐 **Security-first** – Auth, permissions, and audit logging baked in  
- 🌐 **Multi-host support** – Self-hosted or use ShadowDev’s hosted SaaS  
- 🚀 **Game-agnostic** – Designed for FiveM, Roblox, and future integrations  
- 🧩 **Plugin-ready SDK** – Developers can extend everything cleanly  

> The core system is currently in private development.  
> Follow the journey or reach out if you're interested in early access, testing, or contributing once the base is ready.


### 🧾 GreyPanel *(Private Development)*
> **A modern self-hosted billing, client, and admin panel** for game hosting and server providers.  
> Currently in private development — name and scope subject to change.

## 📣 Open to Internships & Opportunities

I'm currently looking for cybersecurity or backend development internships (remote or Des Moines, IA area) starting in Summer or Fall 2025.  
I'm especially interested in roles that involve TypeScript, Node.js, automation, or security tooling — but I’m always open to learning new stacks and contributing wherever I can add value.

If you’re hiring or know someone who is, feel free to reach out!

## 👾 Dev Logs from the Shadow Realm™

> A running archive of questionable decisions, cursed debugging sessions, and the occasional victory lap. Updated as my sanity deteriorates.

- 🧠 *TypeScript once told me a variable was possibly undefined — in the function that literally defined it.*
- 🕯 *Debugged a race condition by printing 13 logs and sacrificing a chicken. It worked. No further questions.*
- 🧱 *Started refactoring a helper function. Four hours later, I had a new auth system and three existential crises.*
- 🔄 *Accidentally wrote a recursive utility that crashed my terminal and taught me the value of `--max-old-space-size`.*
- 🐳 *Docker said “permission denied.” I gave it root. I gave it my soul. Still permission denied.*
- 🚪 *Wrote `exit(1)` just to feel something.*

> _More logs soon. Probably when something breaks in production._

<!--FUN_FACT-->
I swapped a digital dash for analog in an '84 Corvette. Somehow, that was less painful than writing proper role-based auth in TypeScript.
